      "description":["This book presents the innovative concept of the dual function of wave farms as both renewable energy generators and coastal protection elements against erosion and flooding.\n\nDeveloping renewable energy is one of the most pressing targets for society in the coming decades due to the finite nature of fossil fuels, their high costs, and the environmental impacts of their exploration and use, including climate change and the subsequent sea-level rise. Wave energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources, thanks to its huge potential and low impact on the environment. As such, this book discusses the development and application of artificial intelligence to optimise wave farm location and layout, assesses the influence of the wave energy converter geometry on coastal protection against erosion and flooding, and analyses how the performance of wave farms as coastal defence elements is affected by climate change and sea level rise. The concepts, methods and conclusions presented are helpful to students, researchers, academics, engineers, designers, stakeholders and managers around the globe interested in wave energy, coastal engineering, and coastal management.\n\nOptimization of Wave Farm Location and Layout for Coastal Protection\nWave Energy Converter Configuration for Coastal Erosion Mitigation\nWave Energy Converter Configuration for Coastal Flooding Mitigation\nManagement of Coastal Erosion Under Climate Change Through Wave Farms\nManagement of Coastal Flooding Under Climate Change Through Wave Farms"],
