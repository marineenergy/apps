"Because the Project provides structure in a marine environment that has little to no other options for temporary roost sites, hoary bats could roost on the WECs or marker buoys rarely, possibly putting them at risk of predation during daylight hours, although
they would already be susceptible to predation if flying during the day while at sea.

"Because the project turbines would be located in the middle of the river and at a depth of more than 3 feet below the water surface, bank fishing and the use of small boats or sea planes would not be impeded by the project when it is operating; however, fishing lines from anglers in the immediate location of the submerged facility could become entangled with the facility. During the periodic removal and re-installation of the facility, however, boaters and sea planes may need to avoid or maneuver around the area where these activities are being conducted.

"BENTHIC ORGANISMS: Summary – The total area of benthic habitat disturbed at the test site would be very small relative to the range of and available marine habitat for species that use the Project area, and minor in comparison to surrounding available habitat (for full build out, maximum direct effects to the seafloor would occur for about 0.1 percent of the Project area [2 acres] and maximum indirect effects to the seafloor would occur for about 3 percent [48 acres] of the Project area). Effects at PacWave South are expected to be minimized given that anchor installation/removal is not likely to occur more than once a year in a berth and anchors may be deployed for multi-year periods. Any effects on prey availability due to WECs or anchors (if there are any) is expected to be extremely minor, localized, short-term, and temporary, though intermittent throughout the 25- year license term. Thus, benthic habitat disturbance is not expected to adversely affect Project area fish and invertebrates.",1,"Benthic Organisms: Summary – The Total Area Of Benthic Habitat Disturbed At The Test Site Would Be Very Small Relative To The Range Of And Available Marine Habitat For Species That Use The Project Area, And Minor In Comparison To Surrounding Available Habitat (For Full Build Out, Maximum Direct Effects To The Seafloor Would Occur For About 0.1 Percent Of The Project Area [2 Acres] And Maximum Indirect Effects To The Seafloor Would Occur For About 3 Percent [48 Acres] Of The Project Area).

"Researchers reviewed blocks of video footage from portions of the 238 hours recorded during the 2015 deployment. They observed 359 unique interaction events between fish and the device. During these events, approximately 1,202 individual fish from at least six species interacted with the RivGen system. The majority of fish observations were of solitary fish; however, some schools of up to 100 fish encountered the device. Species composition varied between July and August and also between day and night. Salmon smolt were almost exclusively seen at night, and were more prevalent in July than August.

"The AMP is based on fish monitoring that was conducted in 2014 after the sockeye salmon smolt outmigration. During fish monitoring the largest school of fish detected in one observation was 100 fish and this was not during the sockeye smolt outmigration period. As the plan discusses, up to 20,000,000 outmigrating sockeye smolt could pass the RivGen in a single day during this concentrated period of outmigration and about 50,000,000 in the major two-week pulse of sockeye smolt outmigration at the project site.
Project studies and reports do not consider the potential effects of fish alarm pheromones which can occur when the skin of even a single fish is injured and will release a fish alarm pheromone which is very quickly dispersed through the water causing a predator response in all other fish in a school. In salmonids, this results in fish sounding, i.e., they stop swimming and drop quickly to the bottom, which could result in a very large number of fish going through the turbines (Magurran, Irving and Henderson 1996; Sovava et al 2014; and Scott et al 2003).

"The only portions of the device that would obstruct flow, increase water speed, and potentially create scour would be the pontoons. The pontoons are 4.6 feet in diameter, which represents a very small portion of the overall cross section of the river in the project area, and would not lead to a major increase of water speed. We expect scour around the project pontoons to be negligible.  In addition, available information indicates that the majority of the riverbed is composed of coarse gravel, cobbles, and small to medium boulders, all of which require high river velocity for mobilization and are less prone to scour.

"The Project has the potential to affect diving birds in and around the turbine area. Throughout 2006-2008, as discussed above, Verdant Power logged approximately 290 hours of bird observations before and during deployment of the RITE Demonstration Project KHPS units. Birds were observed around the demonstration project to determine if the KHPS units adversely impact diving birds associated with the East River; Verdant Power believes that the body of developed knowledge does not show any signs of impact on diving birds. This detailed effort in and around the RITE project demonstration site and the general area of the proposed RITE Pilot License did not show any material difference in pre-and post-operation bird activity. The presence of more geese flying through the area in post-deployment during the fall of 2008 can be attributed to seasonal migration patterns. Observations during the operation of the RITE Demonstration KHPS units also did not indicate any increased attraction of diving birds to the site which may have been expected if the turbines impacted fish in the area.

The shore station would be installed in an already-cleared area on an existing gravel pad adjacent to an existing transformer and would not stand out significantly against the surrounding landscape which is relatively developed. While painting the shore station with non-reflective colors would reduce its contrast with the surrounding area, doing so would reduce its visibility to those maneuvering vehicles in the turnaround area, some of which could be carrying large loads which could collide with the station.

"Three components of the Reedsport Project represent sources of EMF: the PowerBuoys, the USP, and the subsea transmission cable. In conclusion, the Faraday cages of the PowerBuoy and USP and the metallic sheathing and burying of the project subsea cables will significantly reduce or eliminate E fields from being emitted into the surrounding aquatic environment. Magnetic (B) fields cannot be shielded, and the flow of seawater or organisms through a B field creates a weak electric field (iE field). OPT
 has found no evidence to indicate that magnetic fields negatively affect marine life (Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies 2005; Scott Wilson Ltd. and Downie 2003; Sound & Sea 2002; USACE 2004; Scottish Executive 2007; World Health Organization 2005). However, resource agency staff are concerned that the project differs from traditional sources of anthropogenic EMF in the ocean (underwater power cables). Specifically, agency staff note that instead of a single cable lying on or under the seabed, the proposed project represents 10 PowerBuoys and associated cables running through the entire water column, as well as the multiple cables running along the seabed, converging on the USP. Therefore, instead of a single linear source of EMF, as represented by the subsea cable running from the USP to shore, the proposed project represents a matrix of cables and PowerBuoys spanning the water column and converging on the seabed in the PowerBuoy array area. Resource agencies believe that the potential effects of this unique EMF-generating array should be evaluated in situ and potential effects to identified marine life examined. OPT believes that the proposed EMF Study Plan will allow for the collection of necessary information to evaluate the B fields generated by the project and to confirm that the corresponding E fields are negligible, as anticipated. Comparison of the recorded EMF levels to known thresholds for sensitive species21 will allow for a determination of potential effects, if any, of EMF emitted by the project. Where threshold levels are not available in the literature for species of concern or other surrogates, the Aquatic Resources and Water Quality Committee will be convened to determine appropriate steps through the AMP to understand the effects of the EMF on these species. Also, as part of the Fish and Invertebrates Study, OPT will evaluate if the project affects the local (scale: tens of meters) distribution and abundance of adult Dungeness crab (Appendix C).",3,"Three Components Of The Reedsport Project Represent Sources Of Emf: The Powerbuoys, The Usp, And The Subsea Transmission Cable.

"VESSEL TRAFFIC: Verdant has recently reestablished the USCG approved exclusion zone and is working with the Ferry operators and other marine vessels operators to ensure they understand the updated NOAA charting of the PATON buoys and avoid the exclusion, but staying in the approved Vessel Transit Area, which has adequate area to safely navigate.",1,"Vessel Traffic: Verdant Has Recently Reestablished The Uscg Approved Exclusion Zone And Is Working With The Ferry Operators And Other Marine Vessels Operators To Ensure They Understand The Updated Noaa Charting Of The Paton Buoys And Avoid The Exclusion, But Staying In The Approved Vessel Transit Area, Which Has Adequate Area To Safely Navigate."
"We ... suspect that because the project’s cables would be similar in size and type to anchoring systems associated with navigation buoys, the potential for collisions and injury (of marine mammals) is low. We found no information that would suggest that navigation buoys have resulted in injury to marine mammals. While there would be an array of 10 such cables at the project compared to a single one associated with a
 navigation buoy, the spacing between the cables (60 feet) should be sufficient for most species to avoid hitting the cables.",1,"We ...

"While there is uncertainty about whether electro‐ and magneto‐sensitive species would be capable of detecting EMF emissions from the WECs, as well as the type and degree of these species’ responses to EMF from WECs, the proportion of a given population that might be exposed to site‐specific EMF generated by the Project is expected to be low for most of these species due to factors such as migratory range and available habitat, and low likelihood of exceeding biologically relevant EMF transmissions from WECs.",4,"While There Is Uncertainty About Whether Electro‐ And Magneto‐Sensitive Species Would Be Capable Of Detecting Emf Emissions From The Wecs, As Well As The Type And Degree Of These Species’ Responses To Emf From Wecs, The Proportion Of A Given Population That Might Be Exposed To Site‐Specific Emf Generated By The Project Is Expected To Be Low For Most Of These Species Due To Factors Such As Migratory Range And Available Habitat, And Low Likelihood Of Exceeding Biologically Relevant Emf Transmissions From Wecs."
