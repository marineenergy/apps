2009 - 2017 National AIS at 1 Minute Intervals,"Automatic Identification System (AIS) data are information collected by the U.S. Coast Guard to monitor real-time vessel information to improve navigation safety. Data such as ship name, purpose, course, and speed are acquired 24 hours per day primarily in coastal U.S. waters. However, the data sets featured on this website are the 2009 to 2017 archived AIS data sets intended to be used by the ocean planning community to better understand vessel traffic patterns. These data are provided for analysis in desktop GIS software. For more information, visit the Nationwide Automatic Identification System website.",MarineCadastre.gov,https://www.marinecadastre.gov/,https://marinecadastre.gov/AIS/,1,https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48840|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48841|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48842|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48843|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48845|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48902|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/52805|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/52963|https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/53161,9
2009 Vessel Traffic (AIS),"Derived from 2009 Automatic Identification System (AIS) broadcast returns. Each count per aliquot represents the number of vessels traveling through the block during the year of 2009. An aliquot measures 1/16 of a full OCS leasing block or 1200 x 1200 meters. The original raw data for June, 2009 is missing 25 days of broadcast data. Only areas where BOEM publishes Official Protraction Diagrams will contain the aliquot AIS counts, therefore, large areas of inland state waters may be missing aliquot AIS counts.

2009-2010 Commercial Vessel Density (October - AIS),"These data were generated to provide insight into traffic patterns on a macro scale so they could be analyzed across the coastal waters of the Continental United States. For this dataset, a transit is counted for every unique vessel intersecting a 1 kilometer square grid cell each day. This data represents the total number of vessel transits from October 2009 - October 2010. There were some grid cells which were unable to be processed, but it is not perceived that this interferes with the integrity of these data.

Please note multiple connection errors occurred during the time frame of this study. In most cases, data gaps were filled by making subsequent requests to the Coast Guard or other groups receiving the same data feed. However, due to resource constraints, uninterrupted coverage was not obtained. Overall data outages were minimal, on the order of less than a day per month. Because outages were random and affect all areas uniformly, they do not have a significant effect on the integrity of the data. As stated on the USCG NAIS website, AIS data are not representative of all vessel traffic and USCG NAIS receivers do not fully cover the entire extent of this study area. Please take time to understand both of these limitations.",NOAA Office of Coast Survey,http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/,ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010National.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM10N.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM10S.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM11.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM14.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM15.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM16.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM17.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM18.zip|ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/AIS/CommercialVesselDensityOctober2009_2010UTM19.zip,10,https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48862,1

Citing to the Submerged Lands Act, the ASA generally extends seaward a distance of three nautical miles from the coastline to the inner limit of the outer continental shelf. In the cases of Texas, the Gulf coast of Florida, and Puerto Rico, the ASA extends seaward three marine leagues—or nine nautical miles—from the coastline.

Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships and MARPOL 73/78,"In 1973, the International Maritime Organization adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships and subsequently modified it by Protocol in 1978.  The Convention is widely known as MARPOL 73/78.  Its objective is to limit ship-borne pollution by restricting operational pollution and reducing the possibility of accidental pollution.  MARPOL 73/78 consists of six separate Annexes – each sets out regulations covering the various sources of ship-generated pollution.  Currently, the United States is signatory to Annexes I, II, III, V and VI.  Annexes I, II, V and VI have been incorporated into U.S. law by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and implemented within 33 U.S.C. § 1901 and 33 C.F.R. Part 151.  The AAPS was subsequently amended by the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (1987) and the Marine Pollution Prevention Act (2008).

Many reefs are built using objects intended for other purposes, including the sinking oil rigs, scuttling ships, or deploying rubble or construction debris. Other artificial reefs are purpose-built using materials such as PVC or concrete. Regardless of construction method or source material, artificial reefs generally provide hard surfaces where algae and invertebrates such as barnacles, corals, and oysters can attach. The accumulation of attached marine life in turn provides an intricate structure of food for fish assemblages.

"Atlantic Fishing Revenue Intensity, 2007-2012","This is a single data set from a larger study. The full study is titled ""Socio-Economic Impact of Outer Continental Shelf Wind Energy Development on Fishing in the U.S. Atlantic"". Each quarter square km (500 m) cell has been summed for the mean correlated economic value over the six year period analyzed (2007-2012). This information was created for each state, gear type, Fishery Management Plan (FMP), top 30 exposed ports and top 30 exposed species. This was calculated using Vessel Trip Reports (VTR), Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) which estimates radial distance within which fishing activity is likely to occur, and a 500 m raster cell output. The value is in US dollars for 2012 representing the sum of the mean values for all six years, and then classified into one of the 8 classes. The top 30 species included in this assessment are:  Ocean Quahog, Surf Clam, Little Skate, Squid (Illex & Loligo), Menhaden, Winter Skate, Channeled Whelk, Red Grouper, Atlantic Herring, Vermillion Snapper, Atlantic Croaker, Jonah Crab, Red Hake, Atlantic Mackerel, Silver Hake, King Mackerel, Butterfish, Yellowtail Founder, Winter Flounder, Summer Flounder, Black Sea Bass, Monkfish, Bluefish, Lobster, Spiny Dogfish, Scup, Skates, Cod, Sea Scallop.

Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf Aliquots with Sand Resources,"The Atlantic OCS Aliquots with Sand Resources layer is a planning layer to assist in the management of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sediment resources, reduce multiple use conflicts, minimize interference with existing leases (e.g., renewable energy) and rights-of-way (e.g., submerged infrastructure, shipping lanes, military operations, etc.), and help avoid sensitive areas (e.g., archaeological sites, protected habitat). The aliquots represent areas within the OCS protraction grid where sand resources have been identified through reconnaissance and/or design-level OCS studies. Additional OCS studies may be necessary to refine and quantify the extents of sand resources within these areas. The Marine Minerals Program (MMP) within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is responsible for managing non-energy minerals (primarily sand and gravel) on the OCS. Access to and identification of potential OCS sand resources is critical for the long-term success and cost-effectiveness of many shore protection, beach nourishment, and coastal habitat restoration projects along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean coasts.",Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,http://www.boem.gov/,https://mmis.doi.gov/boemmmis/downloads/layers/ATLSandAliquots_shp.zip,1,https://mmis.doi.gov/boemmmis/metadata/PlanningAndAdministration/ATLSandAliquots.xml,1

"Blue Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities.

Clean Water Act,"The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into U.S. waters and regulating quality standards for surface waters. The basis of the CWA was enacted in 1948 and was called the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, but the Act was significantly reorganized and expanded in 1972. ""Clean Water Act"" became the Act's common name with amendments in 1977. The CWA’s goal is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters. The Act regulates both the direct and indirect discharge of pollutants into navigable waters and waters of the contiguous zone, as well as onto adjoining shorelines, that may be harmful to the public or to natural resources. The term ""navigable waters"" means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas. The term ""territorial seas"" means the belt of the seas measured from the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters, and extending seaward a distance of three miles. The term ""contiguous zone"" means the entire zone established or to be established by the United States under article 24 of the Convention of the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. (Note: the article 24 boundaries differ from the contemporary extent of the territorial seas and contiguous zone.) Federal permits may be required by the EPA for routine discharges of wastes within the Outer Continental Shelf, out to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).",MarineCadastre.gov,https://www.marinecadastre.gov/,ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/Legis-Atlas/FederalGeoregulations/CleanWaterAct.zip,1,https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48856,1

"Fin Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities. This work represents an important step towards understanding marine mammal habitat use with respect to regions utilized by the U. S. Navy.  MarineCadastre.gov has included Blue, Fin, Humpback, and Sperm whale models for the summer months as examples of these models.

Fish Species Richness: Fall,"This layer provides access to a fish species richness map made available by the Marine-life Data and Analysis Team (MDAT) led by the Duke University Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, and including NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Loyola University Chicago, and The Nature Conservancy. For all sampled fish species together, total richness maps are calculated in a GIS by stacking each individual species’ sampled presence (created from the Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation layers) and counting the total number of species present in each cell.

Fish summary products were developed using the NEFSC fall survey data source. The summary map products provide a means to distill multiple layers and time periods into simplified maps and build a general understanding of the ecological richness or abundance in a particular area. Development of these maps required decisions and thresholds that are explained in the Metadata and Publication links.

High Frequency Radar Locations,"These data show the point locations of High Frequency (HF) radar systems across the United States. HF radars measure the speed and direction of ocean surface currents in near real time. These radars, which can operate under any weather conditions, measure currents over a large region of the coastal ocean, as far as 200 km offshore. They are located near the water’s edge, and do not need to be situated atop a high point of land. Dozens of institutions own and operate HF radars within the United States, and many are coordinated through the US Integrated Ocean Observing System. Ocean surface current data from these radars are shared on national servers by the National Data Buoy Center and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.",U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System,https://ioos.noaa.gov/,ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/HighFrequencyRadarLocations.zip|http://cordc.ucsd.edu/projects/mapping/,2,https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/54965,1
"Humpback Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities. This work represents an important step towards understanding marine mammal habitat use with respect to regions utilized by the U. S. Navy.  MarineCadastre.gov has included Blue, Fin, Humpback, and Sperm whale models for the summer months as examples of these models.  Please view the publication for specific details on the development and use of these models.

Individual Deep-Sea Coral Species,"These data predict the likelihood of suitable deep-sea coral habitat maps made available by the NOAA Deep-Sea Coral Research and Technology Program (DSCRTP). The data represent predicted habitat suitability for several taxa of deep-sea corals. Predictions were modeled using a statistical machine-learning algorithm called maximum entropy (MaxEnt). Data provided by DSCRTP and other contributors with environmental and oceanographic data were used to generate the predictive models of deep-sea coral distribution.
 
These models are used to produce regional maps of deep-sea coral habitat. In these regions, deep-sea coral occurs on the continental shelves and slopes, at ocean depths of approximately 50 to greater than 2,000 meters. Model predictions are organized into five hierarchical categories that permit comparison of the data across coral taxa and across regions. The categories correspond to the predicted likelihood of suitable deep-sea coral habitat occurring.

The Secretaries are also required to prepare and periodically revise stock assessments of marine mammal stocks (section 117).  In addition, the Secretary of Commerce must publish in the Federal Register and revise at least annually a list of commercial fisheries that categorizes the fisheries based on the incidence of serious injury and mortality of marine mammals (section 118(c)).

Marine Mammal Species Richness,"This layer provides access to the marine mammal species richness map made available by the Marine-life Data and Analysis Team (MDAT) led by the Duke University Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, and including NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and Loyola University Chicago. For all cetacean species together, total richness maps are calculated in a GIS by stacking each individual species’ predicted presence and counting the total number of species present in each cell. A species is considered present in a cell if the model predicts density above a certain very low density threshold. That threshold is determined by defining the smallest area holding 95% of the total predicted abundance for the species.

National Seafloor Geology (GLORIA),"In 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) began a program to map deep water portions of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) by selecting the long-range side scan sonar system GLORIA (Geological Long-Range Inclined ASDIC).
The USGS selected side-scan sonar as the mapping tool because it could be used to obtain information on geologic processes. The intensity of back-scattered sound from the seafloor is a function of the gradient or slope of the seafloor, surface roughness, and sediment characteristics such as texture.  The darkness or brightness of a feature or an area on the sonographs and completed mosaics is therefore a function of how much sound is reflected from the seafloor.

Ocean Disposal Sites,"In 1972, Congress enacted the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA, also known as the Ocean Dumping Act) to prohibit the dumping of material into the ocean that would unreasonably degrade or endanger human health or the marine environment. Virtually all material ocean dumped today is dredged material (sediments) removed from the bottom of waterbodies in order to maintain navigation channels and berthing areas. Other materials that are currently ocean disposed include fish wastes, human remains, and vessels. Ocean dumping cannot occur unless a permit is issued under the MPRSA. In the case of dredged material, the decision to issue a permit is made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, using EPA's environmental criteria and subject to EPA's concurrence. For all other materials, EPA is the permitting agency. EPA is also responsible for designating recommended ocean dumping sites for all types of materials. Disposal sites with a status of “Available” are available for use and these include all selected and designated sites. Sites with a status of “Discontinued” include all discontinued, historical, or terminated sites. The site with a status of “prohibited” are not available for use, dumping is prohibited.

Ocean Sediment Thickness Contours,"Ocean sediment thickness contours and water depths ranging from 0 – 18,000 meters. These contours were derived from a global sediment thickness grid distributed by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The NCEI grid was compiled from various existing sediment thickness maps and drilling cores, and has a cell resolution of 5 arc seconds. Sediment thickness data is typically acquired through two methods. Seismic (or sub-bottom) profile technologies rely on powerful pulses of low-frequency sound which penetrate the substrate and return information about substrate thickness, character, and stratification. The data are collected along transect lines and require interpolation to create comprehensive maps. Sediment thickness is also determined by direct measurement through coring, which provides more detailed information but only at discrete sites. Coring data can also be interpolated to form area maps, and to help interpret the seismic data.",NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information,https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/,https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/sedthick/data/version3/GlobSed.zip,1,https://data.noaa.gov/waf/NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/MGG/Geophysics/iso/xml/G01065_v2.xml,1

All units for the values are in tons.",MarineCadastre.gov,https://www.marinecadastre.gov/,ftp://csc.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/PrincipalPorts.zip,1,https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/56124,1
Proposed Coastal Critical Habitat Areas,"When a species is proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service must to the maximum extent prudent and determinable propose and designate critical habitat. This dataset is a compilation of the proposed critical habitat areas from NOAA and USFWS listed species in coastal areas. To become officially designated as critical habitat, an area is published as a proposed Federal regulation in the Federal Register. After a period of public review, the comments are adjudicated and the final boundaries of the critical habitat area are published in the Federal Register. When areas are officially designated, they move into the Coastal Critical Habitat Designations layer on MarineCadastre.gov. Because MarineCadastre.gov updates data on a pre-defined cycle, it is possible that proposed layers have been adopted or removed prior to being reflected in this layer. It is important to keep in mind that maps published before May 31, 2012 were only for illustrative purposes and the Federal Register text descriptions should be used for authoritative purposes. For designations published after May 31, 2012, the maps (and any clarifying textual descriptions) are the definitive source for critical habitat boundaries.

"Sperm Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities. This work represents an important step towards understanding marine mammal habitat use with respect to regions utilized by the U. S. Navy.  MarineCadastre.gov has included Blue, Fin, Humpback, and Sperm whale models for the summer months as examples of these models.

West Coast Fishing Ethnography,"Created as part of a 2012 BOEM study on outer continental shelf (OCS) renewable energy space-use conflicts, this data contains the commercial and recreational fishing locations off the Pacific coast of Washington, Oregon and California. The purpose of the study was to begin to identify potential space-use conflicts between OCS renewable energy development and other uses of the ocean environment and recommend measures that BOEM can implement in order to promote avoidance or mitigation of such conflicts, thereby facilitating responsible and efficient development of OCS renewable energy resources. The ethnographic data was created by engaging individuals and small groups in one on one guided discussions, and making handwritten shapes on paper maps to depict fishing locations. These commercial and recreational fishing locations have since been condensed into a single layer.  These are displayed by showing the sum of reported species for a particular area.",Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,http://www.boem.gov/,ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/WestCoastFishingEthnography.zip,1,https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/48944,1

West Coast USA Current and Historical Estuary Extent,"This layer represents historical up-to-present maximum tidal wetlands, or estuaries, for the West Coast of the contiguous United States. The layer includes areas currently inundated by the tides -- ""current tidal wetlands"" – from ocean to head of tide, including the freshwater tidal zone. It also includes ""historical tidal wetlands"", or areas that were historically inundated by tides, but are no longer inundated by tides due to human alterations to the landscape. The tidal wetland mapping combines NOAA's extreme water level models with high-resolution LIDAR digital elevation models (DEMs) to map areas subject to tidal inundation. The mapping was further refined using additional data sources such as the National Wetland Inventory, local knowledge, and aerial photo interpretation. Although the mapping does not yet distinguish current from historical (disconnected) tidal wetlands, a future mapping phase (currently in the data development phase) will provide that information.",Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership,http://www.pacificfishhabitat.org/,https://psmfc.sharefile.com/d-s3f3bf1c275d486b8,1,https://psmfc.sharefile.com/share/view/s459af5f65f8419a9,1
West Coast USA Estuarine Biotic Habitat,"These data represent the Biotic Component (BC) of the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) for estuaries of the West Coast of the contiguous United States. The BC is organized into a branched hierarchy of five nested levels: biotic setting, biotic class, biotic subclass, biotic group, and biotic community. Classes and subclasses of the BC are determined by the dominant biota (defined as the most abundant in terms of percent cover) of the substrate.

Following the methods developed by the Oregon Coastal Management Program (OCMP) – Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development, the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and NOAA’s Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) were cross-walked into select classifications at various levels of the Biotic Component. These classifications were applied to estuaries currently part of the Pacific Estuarine and Marine Fish Habitat Partnership’s (PMEP) inventory (n=444), within the “West Coast USA Current and Historical Estuary Extent” (PMEP) layer.",Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership,http://www.pacificfishhabitat.org/,https://psmfc.sharefile.com/d-s9ec38b8bbd94761b,1,https://psmfc.sharefile.com/share/view/s9bd389f11524f78b,1
Wrecks and Obstructions,"In 1981, NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS) implemented the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) to assist in planning hydrographic survey operations and to catalog and store a substantial volume of reported wrecks and obstructions that are considered navigational hazards within U.S. coastal waters. As part of the hydrographic survey planning process, these records are reviewed and those records which require additional field investigation are assigned to specific field units for verification. The results of these investigations eventually become part of the AWOIS record so that a permanent history of a wreck or obstruction is always available.
AWOIS is not a comprehensive record of wrecks in any particular area. There are wrecks in AWOIS that do not appear on the nautical chart and there are wrecks on the nautical chart that do not appear in AWOIS. Updates to AWOIS are ongoing; however, it will never completely address every known or reported wreck.
