Derelict gear monitoring and removal will be conducted in accordance with the procedures and adaptive management thresholds described below. In addition, NNMREC will participate in monthly FINE meetings, engage with members of the fishing community directly, and maintain ongoing communication with ODFW in regards to lost or entangled gear. Further, NNMREC will consult with NMFS and ODFW, either through their participation in the AMC or otherwise, to ensure the efficacy of the derelict gear monitoring and response methods for the duration of the proposed action. For instance, if derelict gear is routinely found caught on the mooring lines or anchors, monitoring and removal episodes may need to be increased.
General Procedures for Derelict Gear
i. Detection: NNMREC will perform underwater visual monitoring at least three times for each test: once prior to device deployment, once during active deployment, and once after device removal. Video lander sampling of anchors and reference locations will continue for the duration of the proposed action (i.e., when any project related structure or equipment is in the water) weather permitting. In addition, NNMREC will make visual observations from the water surface at least bi-weekly, during all visits to the test site to identify any derelict gear.
ii. Notification: If derelict gear is detected, NNMREC will contact NMFS and ODFW within two days of detection.
iii. Removal: Any gear entangled with project structures or moorings will be removed in spring/summer (prior to test device deployment) or in fall (immediately following test device removal). If the gear poses an entanglement risk to marine organisms, NNMREC will consult with NMFS and ODFW to determine if an earlier or more immediate response is necessary (as described in the Adaptive Management Thresholds below).
iv. Return: NNMREC will make every effort to return gear to owner and will be responsible for storing the gear and contacting the owner to retrieve it; ODFW can provide owner contact information.
v. Recycle: In the event that attempts to return gear are unsuccessful, it may be recycled at the “Fishing for Energy” project located at Newport’s International Port.
Adaptive Management Threshold 1: If Annual Reports indicate that derelict gear is being ensnared on the Ocean Sentinel or project structures and posing harm to species, NNMREC will, after consultation with the AMC, in consultation with and after approval by NMFS and ODFW pursuant to their respective statutory authority, implement one or more of the following actions to ensure compliance with ESA, MMPA and other relevant Federal and state statutes:
o Modify the Adaptive Management Plan to assure that derelict gear is addressed in a timely manner; or
o Modify the Project to reduce the incidences of derelict gear being ensnared on the Ocean Sentinel and/or its mooring configuration.
Adaptive Management Threshold 2: If Annual Reports indicate that derelict gear is being ensnared on and posing harm to species during project tests on WEC devices similar to those proposed for upcoming test, NNMREC will, after consultation with the AMC, in consultation with and after approval by NMFS and ODFW pursuant to their respective statutory authority, implement one or more of the following actions to ensure compliance with ESA, MMPA and other relevant federal and state statutes:

As a matter of practice, NNMREC staff will make visual observations from the water surface during all visits to the test site, and at least all bi-weekly during project deployment. If project devices are not deployed but anchors and mooring lines remain in place during the April/May grey whale migration, NNMREC will perform visual observations at least bi-weekly during that period. NNRMEC will record all opportunistic observations of marine mammals and other listed species and include them in the Annual Report of monitoring results provided to the AMC, NMFS and ODFW. Additionally, NNMREC will coordinate with NMFS and ODFW, either through their participation in the AMC or otherwise, to develop a standard form to use in recording and reporting marine mammal observations.
Adaptive Management Threshold 1: If Annual Reports indicate observations of pinnipeds hauled out on the Ocean Sentinel, NNMREC will, after consultation with the AMC, in consultation with and after approval by NMFS and ODFW pursuant to their respective statutory authority, implement one or more of the following actions to ensure Project compliance with ESA, MMPA and other relevant federal and state statutes:
o Modify the Project to reduce the potential for pinniped haul-out on the Ocean Sentinel; and/or
o Apply for an Incidental Harassment Authorization (IHA) if needed for deterrence or removal of hauled-out pinnipeds.

i. Detection: NNMREC will perform underwater visual monitoring at least three times for each test: once prior to device deployment, once during active deployment, and once after device removal. Video lander sampling of anchors and reference locations will continue for the duration of the proposed action (i.e., when any project related structure or equipment is in the water) weather permitting. In addition, NNMREC will make visual observations from the water surface at least bi-weekly, during all visits to the test site to identify any derelict gear.
ii. Notification: If derelict gear is detected, NNMREC will contact NMFS and ODFW within two days of detection.
iii. Removal: Any gear entangled with project structures or moorings will be removed in spring/summer (prior to test device deployment) or in fall (immediately following test device removal). If the gear poses an entanglement risk to marine organisms, NNMREC will consult with NMFS and ODFW to determine if an earlier or more immediate response is necessary (as described in the Adaptive Management Thresholds below).
iv. Return: NNMREC will make every effort to return gear to owner and will be responsible for storing the gear and contacting the owner to retrieve it; ODFW can provide owner contact information.
v. Recycle: In the event that attempts to return gear are unsuccessful, it may be recycled at the “Fishing for Energy” project located at Newport’s International Port.
Adaptive Management Threshold 1: If Annual Reports indicate that derelict gear is being ensnared on the Ocean Sentinel or project structures and posing harm to species, NNMREC will, after consultation with the AMC, in consultation with and after approval by NMFS and ODFW pursuant to their respective statutory authority, implement one or more of the following actions to ensure compliance with ESA, MMPA and other relevant Federal and state statutes:
o Modify the Adaptive Management Plan to assure that derelict gear is addressed in a timely manner; or
o Modify the Project to reduce the incidences of derelict gear being ensnared on the Ocean Sentinel and/or its mooring configuration.
Adaptive Management Threshold 2: If Annual Reports indicate that derelict gear is being ensnared on and posing harm to species during project tests on WEC devices similar to those proposed for upcoming test, NNMREC will, after consultation with the AMC, in consultation with and after approval by NMFS and ODFW pursuant to their respective statutory authority, implement one or more of the following actions to ensure compliance with ESA, MMPA and other relevant federal and state statutes:

exposure to rapid decompression (Stephenson et al., 2010), pile driving impulsive sound (Halvorsen et al.,

scenario for this species because they are migrant fish and it would be assumed that they would continue

the rotation speed and therefore the generated sound level would have more variability and thus a higher

DRAFT BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT AND ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT ASSESSMENT",NA,"COLLISION, INJURY/MORTALITY",NA,NA,NA,"In summary, Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon, both highly mobile/migratory species, will have a negligible potential to interact with the turbines (foil strike) for the following reasons.
1. The TidGenTM devices are small relative to the cross sectional volume of Cobscook Bay, reducing the likelihood of an encounter.
2. The migratory behavior of Atlantic salmon smolts [rapid movement of individuals following tidal cycles (including smolt migration reversals) that occurs between late April and early June; inhabiting the upper water column and inshore areas away from the Deployment Area] limits the potential for interaction with the TidGenTM devices.
3. Adult Atlantic salmon do not feed during spawning migration and would also be expected to pass through Cobscook Bay rapidly.
4. There are extremely low numbers of returning adult Atlantic salmon through Cobscook Bay which further reduces the potential for turbine interaction.
5. Atlantic sturgeon (and shortnose sturgeon) have never been reported to occur in Cobscook Bay despite extensive marine resource activities in the area and recent netting surveys. No potential spawning habitat occurs in the lower bay and the benthic habitat is dominated by hard substrate and fast tidal currents, which does not provide the preferred foraging habitat. Both sturgeon species are primarily benthic in behavior, especially when foraging and would not be in the water column in the area that the turbine foils are located. Therefore, there is a discountable chance that this species would encounter the Project.
6. Adult Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon species will most likely avoid the devices using typical avoidance behavior to maneuver around obstacles in their path.
  7. The inherent ability of fish to avoid colliding with larger underwater features (AECOM 2009, Coutant and Whitney 2001) and demonstrated avoidance of rotating turbine blades (Amaral et al. 2011). Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon are expected to be able to detect the presence of the turbines in the water column, avoid the turbines using typical avoidance behavior to maneuver around obstacles in their path, and thereby avoiding foil strikes. These typical avoidance maneuvers would not likely result in a negative effect on species behavior or productivity and make the risk of turbine foil strikes minimal.
8. The majority of water flows around, not through, the turbine foils (Wilson et al. 2007).
9. In the unlikely event that a fish interaction occurs, numerous turbine mortality studies conducted for conventional hydropower turbines have concluded that smaller fish, including Atlantic salmon smolts, have very high turbine entrainment survival rates (typically greater than 96 percent). Studies conducted on multiple hydrokinetic turbine designs to date indicate the fish friendly design of ORPC’s TGU can be expected to result in 100% survival for any salmon smolts that may be entrained (Normandeau 2009; EPRI
2010; Amaral et al. 2008 and 2011).
10. Turbine design characteristics that minimize risk of foil strike (slow rotation speed, large
open spacing, a blunt foil leading edge).
11. The important safeguards have been developed to ensure that, in the event monitoring of
the pilot Project show that unexpected adverse effects to ESA-listed species are occurring from foil strike, the turbines can be shut down to cease turbine rotation.",Fish,Physical Interaction.Collision,Marine Energy.Tidal,3. Operations and Maintenance,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

ORPC believes the potential effects of underwater noise/vibration will have a negligible impact to Atlantic salmon during construction, operation, and removal given the brief exposure as salmon migrate through the project area. The noise levels associated with use of an impact hammer during construction pile driving activities may cause avoidance behavior. However, construction will be conducted outside the short migration window for Atlantic salmon smolts. As noted previously, Atlantic sturgeon have never been reported in Cobscook Bay so it is anticipated the given the short duration of the Project, expected noise levels near or below ambient levels (except for use of impact hammer) would not adversely affect Atlantic sturgeon in the extremely rare event they might occur in or near the Deployment Area.",Fish,Noise,Marine Energy.Tidal,ALL,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The current Swimmer Detection Sonar Network SDSN nodes that were installed on the ORPC Beta unit operate at a frequency that is considerably lower than what would be used in a final implementation. They are also much larger and more expensive than the new node that is now under development, which will be a superior candidate for future AAM efforts. Testing performed with the current SDSN nodes, however, demonstrated the effectiveness of SSI’s AAM technology in high-current environments and showed strong detection and tracking performance over a variety of target strengths.
There were two potential issues uncovered by the testing. Firstly, we experienced periods of poor system performance during which detection and tracking failed. This could be due to entrained bubbles being swept under the barge during rough conditions and blocking sound from radiating in front of the node. Further, there were many objects tracked besides the targets during system testing. These are thought to be either seaweed, other debris, or schools of fish moving with the current. Further AAM for this application will include development of the hardware, deployment configuration, and signal processing to deal with these issues.",NA,Noise,Marine Energy.Tidal,1.

The migration routes observed from GPS tracking show that this turtle does not use the East River (Morreale and Standora, 1998; RFMRP, 2010). The habitat in the East River is not likely suitable for foraging opportunities and therefore the Green Turtle does not use this channel as a migration route. The Verdant Project would likely not affect the habitat or individual Green Turtles because the East River does not provide suitable habitat for the Green Turtle.

Because installation of turbines will occur over a short period of time, water quality is expected to return to existing conditions following installation. Due to current velocities within the East River dispersion of re-suspended sediments, if any, would likely occur quickly. In addition, the narrow dimensions of the proposed turbines at the site reduces the amount of habitat affected by shading, and proposed construction activities would not significantly alter the habitat used by fish.

The answer to this question will vary with the type of technology installed. The mechanisms mentioned are largely due to entrainment, entrapment, and entanglement with devices that have moorings, ducts, or shrouds. Please see Reference 6 for a discussion.

Given the extremely energetic and dynamic conditions of high velocity water necessary for the technology, thermal, or chemistry issues are unlikely at a small scale. While mixing phenomenon is important at a large scale, the literature points to concerns only when significantly larger arrays are being considered.
As discussed in the RITE FLA, mixing in the water column in high velocity water has been studied by Verdant at the micro, meso, and macro scales. The effects are extremely limited and water quality parameters are not considered an issue at the RITE site [FLA, Vol. 2, pg.E-82].

The transformation of mechanical to electrical energy within the turbine nacelle is associated with mechanical and electrical losses on the order of 6% of the power generated, which is ultimately rejected from the turbine as heat. Heat transfer is through the nacelle to the high velocity water at the micro scale, with volumes that result in immeasurable temperature rise in the water at the meso scale.

Pilot License (FERC Project # P-13511)",NA,"POTENTIAL INJURY, MORTALITY","The AMP is based on fish monitoring that was conducted in 2014 after the sockeye salmon smolt outmigration. During fish monitoring the largest school of fish detected in one observation was 100 fish and this was not during the sockeye smolt outmigration period. As the plan discusses, up to 20,000,000 outmigrating sockeye smolt could pass the RivGen in a single day during this concentrated period of outmigration and about 50,000,000 in the major two-week pulse of sockeye smolt outmigration at the project site.
Project studies and reports do not consider the potential effects of fish alarm pheromones which can occur when the skin of even a single fish is injured and will release a fish alarm pheromone which is very quickly dispersed through the water causing a predator response in all other fish in a school. In salmonids, this results in fish sounding, i.e., they stop swimming and drop quickly to the bottom, which could result in a very large number of fish going through the turbines (Magurran, Irving and Henderson 1996; Sovava et al 2014; and Scott et al 2003). Video observations of a school of 100 fish cannot adequately inform the behavior of 20,000,000 fish in the same space and time.",NA,"NMFS offers the following EFH conservation recommendations pursuant to section 305(b)(4)(A) of the MSA:
1. During the first year of project operations, shutdown turbines during the two-week peak of sockeye smolt outmigration, and continue video and on-site fish biologist monitoring of project operations without the turbines being operated but with the turbines remaining in place. Until this recommended real-time monitoring and shutdown capability is developed and implemented, NMFS recommends real-time video monitoring of outmigration using video cameras to detect the peak of sockeye smolt outmigration at the project site.
2. Modify the AMP to allow real-time detection of any adverse effects on outmigrating sockeye smolt, and allow rapid shutdown (within one hour of adverse effects or sooner) of the turbines should adverse effects be observed.
3. During the first season of turbine operations during the smolt outmigration, video monitoring should be continuous and review of the video imaging should be of sufficient frequency to allow detection of smolt/turbine interactions and stoppage of turbines within one hour of any such occurrences.
4. After review of the data collected of fish/turbine interactions during smolt outmigration, the Adaptive Management Team, including a NMFS fish biologist, should review the preliminary results and recommend whether or not the turbines can operate without impacts to sockeye smolt during outmigration. The Adaptive Management Team should determine whether to operate during the entire smolt outmigration period in the second year prior to commencement of such operations.
Section 305(b)(4)(B) of the MSA requires the Federal action agency to provide NMFS with a detailed written response to these EFH conservation recommendations within 30 days. If your response is inconsistent with our recommendations, please explain the reasons for not following our recommendations, including the scientific justification for any disagreements over the anticipated effects of the proposed action and the measures needed to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or offset such effects (50 CFR 600.920(j)).",NA,Fish,Physical Interaction.Collision,Marine Energy.Tidal,ALL,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

It aims to support DOE-funded projects that are developing technologies for measuring and monitoring the environment around marine energy devices through the mid- to high-level Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). Ultimately, the initiative is intended to facilitate the permitting process and reduce the overall cost of marine renewable energy.
As part of the initiative, the Igiugig Fish Video Analysis project described herein used video data collected by LGL Alaska around an Ocean Renewable Power Company (ORPC) RivGen® device deployed in Alaska. The data on fish interactions around the operating device were made available to PNNL for further manual/human processing and use in developing automated processing software.
This final report summarizing the project tasks and results follows two previous reports: a data quality report (Trostle 2016) and a project progress report (Avila et al. 2016). The ensuing sections of this report briefly describe the project, the manual analysis of the video data, development of an automated algorithm for detecting fish presence in video frames, development of the software to enable data processing, and finally present conclusions and recommendations for future projects.
