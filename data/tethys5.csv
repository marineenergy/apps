The purpose of the conference was to bring together researchers, industry, consultants, regulators and Non-Government Organizations to share the results of studies into wind farm and wildlife investigations in Australia and New Zealand. The aim was to further networking and communication between these groups. The conference discussed key issues and areas for future investigation, with the intention of developing consistencies in research and management. Like the Conference, the book showcases current research and management in the field of wind farms and wildlife in Australia and New Zealand; establishes consistencies in research and management; and highlights areas in need of further examination. The papers in these Proceedings are presented in two session topics. The first covers “Investigations and assessment of new wind farms” and the second, “Monitoring, mitigation and offsets.”\n\nThe Proceedings then summarize the panel discussions held at the end of the conference. The themes include improving pre- and post-construction survey design; identifying key knowledge gaps and research priorities; uncertainties and errors in data sets and analysis; creating opportunities to share knowledge; and assessing cumulative impacts across multiple sites.\n\nContents\nSection 1: Investigations and Assessments of New Wind Farms\nPredicting the Weather-Dependent Collision Risk for Birds at Wind Farms (Henrik Skov, Stefan Heinänen) - Pages 3-21\nFauna Collisions with Wind Turbines: Effects and Impacts, Individuals and Populations.

Metrics and methods for determining or monitoring potential impacts on birds at existing and proposed wind energy sites""],""description"":[""In the 1980s little was known about the potential environmental effects associated with large scale wind energy development. Although wind turbines have been used in farming and remote location applications throughout this country for centuries, impacts on birds resulting from these dispersed turbines had not been reported. Thus early wind energy developments were planned, permitted, constructed, and operated with little consideration for the potential effects on birds. In the ensuing years wind plant impacts on birds became a source of concern among a number of stakeholder groups. Based on the studies that have been done to date, significant levels of bird fatalities have been identified at only one major commercial wind energy development in the United States. Research on wind energy/bird interactions has spanned such a wide variety of protocols and vastly different levels of study effort that it is difficult to make comparisons among study findings. As a result there continues to be interest, confusion, and concern over wind energy development''s potential impacts on birds. Some hypothesize that technology changes, such as less dense wind farms with larger, slower-moving turbines, will decrease the number of bird fatalities from wind turbines. Others hypothesize that, because the tip speed may be the same or faster, new turbines will not result in decreased bird fatalities but may actually increase bird impacts. Statistically significant data sets from scientifically rigorous studies will be required before either hypothesis can be tested.""],""author"":[[""Anderson, R.""],[""Morrison, M.""],[""Sinclair, K.""],[""Strickland, D.""]],""organization"":[[""National Wind Coordinating Collaborative""]],""originationDate"":[""1999-01-01""],""spatial"":{""coordinates"":[[""38.909213000000""],[""-77.009419000000""]],""extent"":[""Point""]},""technologyType"":[[""Wind Energy (General)""]],""tags"":[[""Environment""],[""Birds""]],""modifiedDate"":[""2019-12-20 09:39:53""],""signatureProject"":[""""]}"

The meeting, like its predecessors in Nyborg, Denmark (2007; Hawkins et al. 2008), and Cork, Ireland (2010; Popper and Hawkins 2012), introduced participants to the most recent research on the effects of man-made noise on aquatic animals and the aquatic environment. Almost 250 scientists, acousticians, engineers, regulators, and representatives of industry and environmental groups from 24 countries came together to share data and ideas and to meet colleagues with interests across the range of topics covered at the meeting. The effects of noise on a wide range of animals were discussed and debated over the 5 days of the conference, as were issues related to different sound sources, national and international regulations, and the interests of industrial and environmental groups. The animals considered included marine mammals, turtles, amphibians, fishes, and invertebrates.\n\nThe various themes of the meeting were chosen to cover the principal subjects of current interest. They included the hearing abilities of aquatic animals; communication by means of underwater sound; the description of aquatic soundscapes; different sound sources and their characteristics; the effects of sound on behavior; and assessing, mitigating, and monitoring the effects of aquatic noise. There is now increasing interest by the general public in the impact of underwater noise, while there is a continuing requirement for governments and industry to conduct formal assessments of the impact of offshore developments. As a consequence, special panels (see the Chapters 159 by Erbe et al., 160 by Johnson and Dolan, 161 by Lewankowski et al., and 162 by Scowcroft) were convened to discuss two especially relevant topics: ways of communicating the results of science to the general public and how best to facilitate closer interaction between regulators and those being regulated.\n\nPapers were submitted by a large number of participants and this generated a very full program. The idea previously tested in Nyborg and Cork of having several sessions of short, rapid-fire presentations about various posters was further developed and proved a great success. The rapid-fire talks added value to the large number of poster presentations and allowed their presenters to draw attention to the wide range of new studies of underwater noise and its effects.\n\nSince the original Nyborg meeting, there has been an enormous increase of interest in underwater noise. The development of offshore renewable energy resources, dredging for aggregates, construction activities, the use of sonars, increases in commercial shipping, and the further development of the offshore oil and gas industry have led to increasing work by scientists and engineers on the effects of this noise. Our three conferences have brought together a whole community of people engaged in work on underwater noise and have enabled a very full exchange of ideas to take place. Many people are now looking forward to the next conference, to be held in 2016 in Dublin.\n\nFinally, a note about the “organization” of this book. From looking over the various chapters, it is clear that they could have been organized any number of ways. This could have been, for example, based on animal groups, sound sources, experimental approaches, and other ways. Since we could not come up with a scheme that we thought would satisfy everyone (or even ourselves), we took the approach that we would present the papers in alphabetical order of the first author, and then let readers either browse the volume or do electronic searches on the PDF or electronic versions of the volume. This decision is, of course, based in part that most people will view the book in electronic form, as is so often the case for new books today.""],""author"":[[""Popper, A.""],[""Hawkins, A.""]],""organization"":[""""],""originationDate"":[""2016-01-01""],""spatial"":{""coordinates"":[[""47.508500000000""],[""19.049959000000""]],""extent"":[""Point""]},""technologyType"":[""""],""tags"":[[""Environment""],[""Noise""]],""modifiedDate"":[""2019-12-20 09:39:53""],""signatureProject"":[""""]}"
