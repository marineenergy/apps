# shiny-apps

Normally, on command line, get this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhk-env/mhk-env_shiny-apps
```

Or in Rstudio, File -> New Project... -> Version Control -> git ...

Might need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## todo

To get Rmd to show, eg https://mhk-env.github.io/shiny-apps/ply2rwhale.html, had to delete sym linked index.html that pointed to `/opt/shiny-server/samples/welcome.html`.
